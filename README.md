Fork of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui

This to make a proper package to have the Ultimaker 3 serve it's own API documentation.
The actual documentation file is supplied by the opinicus package.

This is just the support package to properly format and display the documentation.


=Modifications
* Cleaned out everything except the "dist" folder that we need.
* Modified dist/index.html to match our needs.
* Created CMake files to build a package
